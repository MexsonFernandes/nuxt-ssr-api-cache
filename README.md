# nuxt-ssr-api-cache

App is deployed on Vercel at https://nuxt-ssr-api-cache.vercel.app/

API at https://github-counter.glitch.me/api_call.svg.

Now save bucks by caching the api calls.

So the plan is,
- SSR will cache the server api calls.
- You will hit api only when project build takes place.
- Start a cron job at midnight.
- You save tons in api calls.

Hurray!!
